        <p class="lead text-muted">
            Form 16 Part A is issued by your employer and contains the details of the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on your salary. This is a crucial document for filing your Income Tax Return.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4 text-primary">Key Components of Part A</h3>
        <p>
            Part A provides a summary of all tax-related information between you and your employer for a specific financial year.
        </p>
        <ul class="info-list">
            <li><strong>Employer and Employee Details:</strong> This includes your name, address, PAN (Permanent Account Number), and the TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) of your employer.</li>
            <li><strong>Quarterly TDS Summary:</strong> A detailed breakdown of the tax deducted by your employer each quarter of the financial year.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Deposited:</strong> The total amount of tax deposited by your employer with the government on your behalf, along with the date and mode of payment.</li>
            <li><strong>Assessment Year:</strong> The year in which your income is assessed for taxation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-5 text-primary">Why is it important?</h3>
        <p>
            Part A serves as proof of the tax you have already paid. When you file your tax return, you must cross-verify the TDS details from your Form 16 Part A with the information in your Form 26AS, an online tax statement. This ensures that the tax paid by your employer has been correctly credited to your account.
