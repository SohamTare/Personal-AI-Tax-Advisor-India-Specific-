        <p class="lead text-muted">
            TDS, or Tax Deducted at Source, is a mechanism where a person or company paying you for a specific service or salary is required to deduct a certain amount of tax and deposit it with the government.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4 text-primary">How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
            When a payment is made, such as your salary, interest, commission, or professional fees, the payer deducts a small portion of the amount as tax. This deducted amount is then deposited to the Income Tax Department on your behalf.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4 text-primary">Who deducts TDS?</h3>
        <p>
            The deductor (the person making the payment) can be an individual, a company, a firm, or a co-operative society. For salaried employees, the employer is the deductor.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4 text-primary">How does it affect me?</h3>
        <p>
            The tax already deducted is reflected in your Form 16 (for salaried employees) and in Form 26AS. When you file your income tax return, this TDS amount is considered a tax you have already paid. This helps in either reducing your final tax liability or, if more tax was deducted than required, claiming a refund.
