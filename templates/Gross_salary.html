            Understanding the difference between gross salary and taxable income is the first step to smart tax planning. These two numbers are often confused but are fundamentally different.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4 text-primary">What is Gross Salary?</h3>
        <p>
            Your Gross Salary is the total amount of money you earn from your employer before any deductions are made. This includes your basic salary, all allowances (like House Rent Allowance, Dearness Allowance, etc.), bonuses, and any other perquisites. It represents your total earnings for a given period.
        </p>
        <ul class="info-list">
            <li>**Key takeaway:** Gross Salary is your total earnings before any reductions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-5 text-primary">What is Taxable Income?</h3>
        <p>
            Your Taxable Income is the final amount on which your income tax is actually calculated. It is derived by taking your Gross Salary and subtracting all eligible exemptions and deductions. This is the amount that the government's tax slabs and rates are applied to.
        </p>
        <ul class="info-list">
            <li>**Calculation:** Taxable Income = Gross Salary - Exemptions - Deductions.</li>
            <li>**Key takeaway:** This is the number you want to reduce as much as possible to lower your tax liability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-5 text-primary">Why is the difference important?</h3>
        <p>
            The difference is crucial because it highlights your potential for tax savings. By making smart investments and expenses, you can increase your deductions and, in turn, reduce your taxable income. This is the core principle behind tax planning, and it's what our tool is designed to help you with.
